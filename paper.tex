\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\todo{update as appropriate}

In this paper we have shown that it is possible to create a monitoring solution which provides basic insight into web service utilization and performance  with very little effort from the developer. The user group that we are aiming for with this work is application developers using Flask and Python to build web applications with limited or no budget for implementing their own monitoring solutions. The emphasis is in allowing such users to gain insight into how the performance of the service evolves together with the application itself. We believe that the same architecture, and lessons can be applied to other frameworks and other languages.

In the future, we plan to perform case studies with other sytstems, with the goal of discover other needs and to wean out the less useful visualizations in the \tool. We plan to also extend the tool towards supporting multiple deployments of the same applications across multiple nodes (e.g. for the situations where the application is deployed together with a load balancer). Finally, we plan to integrate \tool with unit testing as a complementary source of information about performance evolution.
